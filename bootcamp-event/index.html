With a curriculum focused on today’s best practices led by a world-class instructor team, you’ll graduate from Juno with the skills and knowledge you'll need to land a web developer position. With an average starting salary of $54,449 and 81% employment within 120 days of graduation, our proven process will get you there.</p>

    <h2 class="section1__h20">The Best of the Best
        </h2>
        <p class="section1__p1">Our selective admissions process allows us to round out each cohort with a diverse group of highly motivated and skilled students. When you’re accepted into Bootcamp, you’re joining a community of driven people who share your career goals and values. What follows is a life-changing nine weeks that will prepare you for a career transition, with lasting friendships formed along the way. Our Bootcamp is challenging for sure, but you’ll come out of it primed for success and a new career. Not to mention incredibly proud of yourself.</p>
        <h2 class="section1__h21">A Win-Win Approach to Paying Tuition</h2>
        <p class="section1__p2">As the first school in Canada offering Income Share Agreements, every Canadian now has the opportunity to pursue a web development career with us. Students who choose to fund their education through Income Share Agreements will pay just $1 upfront. Once they are earning $50,000 per year or more, they pay back 17% of their income to Juno for two years. Incentives have never been more aligned between a school and its students; we only succeed when you do.</p>
