* For example, I want to borrow a loan of 3700 dollars and I want to repay that over 16 months.
* And the interest rate is 15 percent.
* So it tells me the amount, This is the monthly payment.
* I will pay over 16 months for me to pay off the loan.
* And you can also adjust the "Interest Rate , Months to pay and also whatever you want to put the value in Loan Amount" .
* That's basically what I have made.
