# Pairs Game
 A game of pairs using Javascript.

 I've kept the styling simple as the main thing users need to see is the images so that they can easily match them.

 I experimented with the flipping animation of the cards as the transition had to be satisfying to the player. I ended up using a 1s ease-in-out transition.

 The game includes a timer and compares the time each time the user plays so that they can attempt to beat their best score. The timer is executed using the setTimer() function.

 When the player has matched all the pairs, a modal message will display which will be personalised depending on whether the player has beaten their best score.
