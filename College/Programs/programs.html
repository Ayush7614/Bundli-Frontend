                            <p id="csz">Computer Engineering, also called Computer System Engineering, is a discipline that integrates several fields Electrical engineering and computer science required to develop computer system. Computer engineers usually have
                                training in electronic engineering, software design a hardware software integration instead of only software engineering or electronic engineering. Computer engineers embed computers in other machines and systems. Build
                                networks to transfer date and develop ways to make computers faster, smaller and more capable. Computer engineers are improving the ability computers to see and think. They are making computers more mobile and even incorporating
                                computers into fabrics, clothes and building materials. They are concerned with analyzing and solving computer oriented problems. The knowledge of both the "body" means hardware and the "mind" means software of a computer
                                helps computer engineers computer system but also how they integrate into larger scenario of changing technical world.&nbsp; <br> The major technical areas are: <br> * Networking<br> * Computer software<br> * VLSI and design
                                automation
                                <br> * Bio-medical<br> * Machine intelligence<br> * Careers<br>Typical Industries living computer engineers, include financial services, computer manufactures, chemical companies, defense contractors, consulting transportation,
                                consumer goods manufacturing, computer engineers are equally successful in large multinational firms and small star.

                                    transmission and distribution of electrical power so electrical engineering is also called high voltage engineering or power engineering. The importance of electrical engineering is much more for our country because
                                    our country because our country is the second richest country in water resources in the world and several megawatts of electrical power can be generated. There is so many scopes of electrical engineering such as government,
